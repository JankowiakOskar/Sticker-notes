# Sticker Notes - short brief

App made for self development and to expand knowledge of huge React ecosystem.
I used there a lot of currently using front-end technologies.
In Brief it's CRUD, where you can store your notes,
photos, search them by typing words, adding new and filter to favorites. App also has
authorisation with JWT Token, form's and validations where i used Formik and Yup.
